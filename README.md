# [Blockchain Commons BIP-39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39)

**Implementation of BIP-39 "Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys" standard for use in [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) Software Projects**

## Prerequisites

* If [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.

## Installation

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

This sequence runs the module's unit tests.

## Use

1. Link against `libbc-bip39.a` and `libbc-crypto-base.a`.
2. Include the umbrella header in your code:

```c
#include <bc-bip39/bc-bip39.h>
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make distcheck
$ make distclean
```

`make distcheck` builds a distribution tarball, unpacks it, then configures, builds, and runs unit tests from it, then performs an install and uninstall from a non-system directory and makes sure the uninstall leaves it clean. `make distclean` removes all known byproduct files, and unless you've added files of your own, should leave the directory in a state that could be tarballed for distribution. After a `make distclean` you'll have to run `./configure` again.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
